You can find many PSP games online in ISO/CSO format, which are compressed versions of the original discs. You can download these games and transfer them to your PSP memory stick using a USB cable or a card reader. Then you can **play games on PSP** without needing the physical discs.

Custom firmware is a modified version of the official firmware that runs on PSP. It gives you more features and options than the original firmware, such as the ability to play games from other regions, run homebrew applications, and access the recovery menu. Custom firmware is usually installed by using a special program called a "hacker" or a "downgrader" that exploits a vulnerability in the PSP system.
  
However, installing custom firmware on PSP is not without risks. It may void your warranty, damage your device, or expose you to legal issues. You should always backup your data and follow the instructions carefully before attempting to hack your PSP. You should also be aware of the potential consequences of downloading and playing pirated games, which may be illegal in your country and harm the game developers.
  
If you decide to hack your PSP and play games from your memory stick, you will need a compatible device and a large enough storage space. The PSP models that can be hacked are the PSP-1000, PSP-2000, PSP-3000, PSP Go, and PSP E1000. The newer models, such as the PSP Street and the PS Vita, cannot be hacked. You will also need a memory stick with enough capacity to store your games. The size of each game varies depending on the compression level and the content. A typical ISO/CSO game can range from 100 MB to 2 GB.
